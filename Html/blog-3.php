            <h1>How do tips work at getMyFood?</h1>
            <p class="blog-p">In the last couple of years, our Tech and Logistics teams have made significant changes to how tips work. From what it was, when we started the tipping feature on Zomato online ordering application back in 2019, we've certainly come a long way. For one, now our delivery partners are notified immediately of a customer's generosity. 
                While we were rolling out these changes and diving deep into the world of tips in India, we learnt that, as a country, we're quite new to this habit. Here are a few facts that put it in perspective -
                One of the reasons that prevent people from tipping is that there exists an array of commonly-believed misconceptions. Out of these, the following two are the most widespread -
                &emsp;<li>&emsp;A lot of people think that the tips given via the Zomato platform are not transferred to delivery partners in full. A part of it is taken as convenience or platform fees</li>  
                <li>&emsp;Tips are transferred to the bank accounts of delivery partners along with their monthly or weekly payout and not on the same day</li><br>           
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p">
                However, the truth can't be far from this. As an organisation, we are keen on improving the lives of delivery partners and helping them achieve their financial goals. 
                Whatever amount delivery partners get in tips, 100% of it is transferred to their accounts directly. In fact, we absorb all payment gateway charges, including administrative and convenience fees, to ensure tips remain 100% transferrable. 
                As for the timeline, tips don't form a part of the weekly payouts. We transfer tips as and when they are received i.e., on an ongoing basis. Fun fact: of all the tips we get, we transfer ~80% of them to delivery partners' bank accounts within 60 minutes of receiving them. 
                All in all, we credit 92% of the tips to delivery partners' accounts within 24 hours of delivery being completed. We are working with our banking partners to ensure we hit 100% here, at the earliest.

            <h3>Communicating more </h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
                As a platform connecting multiple stakeholders, our responsibility exceeds just developing better processes. We also need to build trust and transparency at every stage of our stakeholder journey - be it for our customers, restaurant partners or delivery partners. As the first steps towards this, we've started sharing more information about our initiatives on the customer and delivery partner apps.<br>
                For instance, on the customer app, we actively showcase why tips are more important during certain days (for instance, festivals, weekends, late-night deliveries, rainy season).
