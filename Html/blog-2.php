            <h1>How love for food made me participate in HackaNoodle?</h1>
            <p class="blog-p">What do you say when someone asks you why are you participating in a Hackathon? Saying that you've come to a hackathon for (free) food is not the ideal response, and more so to a CEO. <br>
                It was a Saturday morning, and I was in the Zomato headquarters for a hackathon. Our team was working in one of the many glass meeting rooms when a serious-looking man in a black hoodie walked in and introduced himself, saying, “Hi, I'm Deepi”. <br>
                Hearing this, one of my teammates said, “I got it”. I, on the other hand, was super confused. I thought, maybe, I heard 'DP', which is an acronym for 'delivery partner' at Zomato. I thought it was an internal joke I was unaware of. So, I just smiled and let it pass. <br>
                We began talking about the project, and after sharing and receiving a few suggestions, the man in black asked, “Yahan kya karne aaye ho?”, which loosely translates to “what are you doing here?” I mentioned the first (honest) thing that came to my mind, “khaana khaane”, translating to “to have food”. And, we all had a hearty laugh. <br>
                Shortly after he left, my teammate, who was smiling earlier, nudged me and said it was the founder you were speaking with. It took me a good ten minutes to let that sink in. <br>
                Well, this is one of the many unusual things that happened last weekend at the headquarters. Let's start from the beginning.  <br>
                A few weeks back, I was browsing through my LinkedIn feed and came across a post on HackaNoodle - a hackathon powered by Zomato & Blinkit, with a special focus on women and the Trans community. A big fan of hackathons/coding competitions in general, I quickly opened the link to learn more about it and, soon after, registered my name. <br>
                Since HackaNoodle was scheduled for November, we all had a few days to form our teams. We made a team of four - Ritika Patel, Palak Bansal, Akshit Sehgal, and me (Nihal Gupta). We started meeting online on Zoom calls to brainstorm what we wanted to build. With Diwali and festive preparations, the days went by quickly. Finally, the much-awaited weekend was here. <br>

            <h3>The D-day</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
                On November 5th, we all were standing outside a large building in Gurugram with a huge, red board on top reading 'Zomato'. It did not feel like anything big until we stepped in. But oh, how it all changed as soon as I entered the office. I could feel the energy all around me - hundreds of coders, a lot of hustle, and the crew welcoming each of us. However, one thing that (pleasantly) surprised me was the number of women present there. We had 40+ teams, and all of them were led by women. <br>
                At the gates, we all got our goodie bags. Like a child, I took my bag aside, found the nearest table, sat there and started unpacking everything one by one. There was a cool black hoodie with my name written on it (which I wore then and there), a laptop pad, a water bottle, stickers (special thanks to the person who included cool stickers in the goodie bag, I love pasting stickers on my laptop), and a few munchies.
