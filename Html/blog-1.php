            <h1>How Hyperpure is helping restaurants in their growth journey...</h1>
            <p class="blog-p">“It all comes back to the basics. Serve customers the best-tasting food at a good value in a clean, comfortable restaurant, and they'll keep coming back.” - Dave Thomas
            In the restaurant industry, the goal is usually simple (but not easy) - to provide the best experiences to customers. However, the journey of achieving this goal distinguishes great places from the good.

            <h3>Why we started Hyperpure?</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
                Running a restaurant is hard - it requires one to solve a number of day-to-day challenges. While every restaurant has a different set of challenges, one is common to all - maintaining consistent food quality. To ensure good quality, restaurants spend a lot of time optimising their supply chain and kitchen operations - a process that takes a significant amount of time and effort. 
                To understand the problem in detail, we spoke to numerous restaurants. And after multiple conversations, we realised there are three persistent problems frequently faced by restaurateurs:<br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;1.&emsp; Restaurants have to rely on a larger network of vendors as no single vendor provides a broader basket of ingredients. Balancing the pricing-quality equation across a big set of vendors is time-consuming and often impractical.<br>
                    &emsp;2.&emsp; Inventory management across a wide set of ingredients is incredibly tough. To manage their procurement costs, restaurants tend to buy in bulk - a large part of the cost advantage gets lost in wastage, lower yields (due to inconsistent quality), and even pilferage.<br>
                    &emsp;3.&emsp; On-time delivery of ingredients, especially fresh ingredients, is a challenge. As a result, restaurants have to waste the early hours of their operations on vendor and on-route coordination.<br>
                
                <br>
                Scaling the business with these challenges is a herculean task. We wanted to solve this so that the restaurants could dedicate their time in doing what they know best - creating excellent gastronomical experiences.
